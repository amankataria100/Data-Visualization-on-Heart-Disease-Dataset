Data Visualization on Heart Disease Dataset

Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze heart disease data to identify key risk factors and gain insights through data visualization. By exploring various attributes, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends that can help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease.

Tasks

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Standardize formats for analysis.
Data Visualization

Plot distributions for key attributes such as:
Age
Cholesterol
Blood Pressure
Create a heatmap to identify feature correlations.
Use box plots and scatter plots to visualize trends.
Generate a pie chart to show the distribution of heart disease cases.
Key Insights

Analyze visualized data to extract actionable insights regarding heart disease risk factors.
Tools and Technologies

Python: Primary programming language for analysis and visualization.
Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Advanced visualizations for feature correlations and trends.
